# My Doctor Device System - Starter Pack

This is a starter scaffold for **My Doctor Device System** — a web + device project.
It includes:
- `frontend/` - minimal React (Vite) app (2 screens)
- `backend/` - Node.js + Express API with SQLite (endpoints: auth stub, vitals, patients)
- `simulator/` - Python script to simulate a device posting vitals
- `README.md` (this file)

## Quick setup

### Backend
1. Open a terminal in `backend/`
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Start server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   Server runs on `http://localhost:4000`

### Frontend
1. Open a terminal in `frontend/`
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Start dev server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   Frontend runs on `http://localhost:5173` (Vite default)

### Simulator
1. Install Python dependencies (requests):
   ```bash
   pip install requests
   ```
2. Run:
   ```bash
   python simulator/send_vitals.py
   ```

## Notes
- This scaffold aims to be simple and educational. It uses SQLite for quick local demos.
- Authentication is a minimal stub for demo purposes — do not use in production.
- For real device integration, switch to MQTT or secure HTTPS and implement proper auth.
